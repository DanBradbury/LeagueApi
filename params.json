{"name":"Leagueapi","tagline":"Gem to access Riot developer APIs","body":"# Why LeagueApi?\r\nRiot has recently put out a set of API methods that can be called through a simple request model. Found on the [Riot Developer Site](http://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods). \r\n\r\nThere are a few other projects that are looking to support the API in ruby already. I recommend checking them out to see if one they are a better fit for you. \r\n\r\n* [riot_api](https://github.com/petems/riot_api) - Looks like it is still alive but bulky for my liking (60KB)\r\n* [Vigor](https://github.com/PeterBorah/vigor) - Smaller implementation using httparty\r\n* [Ruby Lol](https://github.com/mikamai/ruby-lol) - Large implementation with many contributors \r\n* [Sightstone](https://github.com/danijoo/Sightstone) - Uses rest-client but looks to be clean\r\n* [riot-api](https://github.com/anujan/riot-api) - Another httparty implementation\r\n* [strife](http://www.github.com/wanthony/strife) - faraday-http-cache + swayer implementation\r\n* [riot_client](https://github.com/franciscomxs/riot_client) - rest client\r\n* [Outrageous](http://github.com/xxswingxx/outrageous) - httparty\r\n\r\nI saw these all as large projects up to 60K with many different implementations. \r\n\r\nThis gem has no dependencies other than Ruby. Allowing for a lightweight and flexible design to support a wide variety of use cases with little to no effort.\r\n\r\n## Mapping\r\nThe mapping refers to the fact that this gem contains a direct unfiltered call to the Riot APIs to allow the flexibility to fetch exactly what you want and need. Every API method is available directly from the Riot specified categories (Game, Champion, League, etc)\r\n\r\nReference the [gem docs](http://rubydoc.info/gems/league_api/0.2.1/frames) for more information on the exact naming of these calls. \r\n\r\nYou can also use `LeagueApi.available_requests` to see a list of requests that are currently available. \r\n\r\n## Convenience\r\nIn order to properly support many use cases there is some work to be done with the JSON we have access to. Because of this there are a set of convenience methods that we can use. \r\n\r\n### CDN for Images \r\nSummoner icons, Items, and Champions have all been linked to the ddragon CDN to allow for easy access. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDan Bradbury (@DanBradbury)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more information take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/DanBradbury/LeagueApi/wiki) for more specific use cases. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
